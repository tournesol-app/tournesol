# Tournesol Data Visualization

The Tournesol public data visualization tool made with Streamlit.

This application allows to explore:
- the Tournesol public dataset made of users' individual ratings
- the resulting collective scores computed by the back end's algorithms

## Install

Create a new Python virtual environment, and install the requirements. Be sure
to use one virtual environment per Python projects in the Tournesol repository
to not mix dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

To run Sreamlit on a localhost:

```bash
streamlit run Tournesol_Data_Visualization.py
```
