## Development guidelines

This section contains the development documentations, and the contributing
guidelines we would like every contributor to follow.

### Documentation

The documentations for developing and distributing web extensions are
available here:
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions

### Install the development tools

```shell
yarn install
```

### Prepare the extension

Before loading the extension into your browser, you need to run `yarn configure`. It will generate `manifest.json`, `config.js` and the import wrappers (small scripts that allow us to use ECMAScript modules in content scripts).

By default, the script creates an extension that connects to the production Tournesol website. If you want to connect to your development servers, you can run `yarn configure:dev` instead.

### Code Quality

We use `ESLint` to find and fix problems in the JavaScript code.

Before submitting new pull requests, run the linter with the following
commands:

```shell
yarn lint

# automatically fix problems
yarn lint --fix
```

### Updating the version

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning][semantic-versioning].

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when backwards **incompatible** changes are made
- `MINOR` version when new backwards **compatible** functionalities are added
- `PATCH` version for backwards **compatible** bug fixes

## Release a new version

To release the extension on Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, run the script `./build.sh`
and upload the generated .zip file in the corresponding extension web store.
