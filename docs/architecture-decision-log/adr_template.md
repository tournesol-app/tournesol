## Summary

### Issue

Describe the architectural design issue we're addressing, leaving no questions
about why we're addressing this issue now.

### Decision

Clearly state the position we've selected.

## Details

### Assumptions


### Constraints

### Positions

List the positions, viable options or alternatives, we considered.

This section also helps ensure that we heard everyone' opinions.

### Arguments

Outline why we selected a position.

This is probably as important as the decision itself.

### Implications

A decision comes with many implications.

For example, a decision might introduce a need to make other decisions, create
new requirements, or modify existing requirements; pose additional constraints
to the environment; or require additional staff training, etc.

## Related

### Related decisions

When many decisions are related, we can list them here.

### Related requirements

Map the decision to objectives and requirements.

### Related artifacts

List the related architecture, design, or scope documents that this decision
impacts.

### Related principles

If the project has an agreed-upon set of principles, make sure the decision is
consistent with one or more of them.

## Notes

Because the decision-making process can be long, it's useful to capture notes
and issues that the team discusses during the socialization process.
