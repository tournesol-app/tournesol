## Summary

### Issue

Briefly summarize the organization's situation.

Describe the architectural design issue we're addressing, leaving no questions
about why we're addressing this issue now.

### Decision

Clearly state the position we've selected.

## Details

### Assumptions

Clearly describe the underlying assumptions in the environment in which we're
making the decision.

Include rationale and considerations based on social and skills makeups of the
teams.

### Constraints

Include any additional constraints to the environment that the chosen position
might pose.

### Positions

This section also helps ensure that we heard everyone' opinions.

### Arguments

This is probably as important as the decision itself.

### Implications

List the implications that come with the position.

**Right approach** - We need to start doing X instead of Y.

**Wrong approach** - Explaining the position in terms of pros and cons.
