{% blocktranslate %}We would like to thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project. Your comparisons
already improve the public dataset and the recommendations made to thousands of users.{% endblocktranslate %}

{% blocktranslate %}This participatory research project works thanks to contributors who, like you, volunteer
their time to compare videos. If you have time, we hope to see you again on the Tournesol platform. Every comparison you
make will help advance scientific research on ethics and security of algorithms and recommender
systems.{% endblocktranslate %}

{% blocktranslate %}You can also install the Tournesol browser extension to easily compare videos directly from
YouTube, or to add them to your rate-later list.{% endblocktranslate %}

{% blocktranslate %}If every registered user made at least 10 comparisons, the quality of the public database
would double! This would be a huge step forward for the project.{% endblocktranslate %}
