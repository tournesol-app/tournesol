{% blocktranslate %}We would like to thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project. Your comparisons
already improve the public dataset and the recommendations made to thousands of users.{% endblocktranslate %}

{% blocktranslate %}This participatory research project works thanks to contributors who, like you, volunteer
their time to compare videos. If you have time, we hope to see you again on the Tournesol platform. Every comparison you
make will help advance scientific research on ethics and security of algorithms and recommender
systems.{% endblocktranslate %}

{% blocktranslate %}If every registered user makes at least 10 comparisons, the size of the Tournesol public
database will double! This would be a huge step forward for the project.{% endblocktranslate %}
