their time to compare videos. If you have time, we hope to see you again on the Tournesol platform. Every comparison you
make will help advance scientific research on ethics and security of algorithms and recommender
systems.{% endblocktranslate %}

would double! This would be a huge step forward for the project.{% endblocktranslate %}
