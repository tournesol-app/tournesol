      in terms of food, sport activities or mental health. They may also include more
      altruistic habits, such as being kinder to others (including on the Internet), reducing
      our carbon footprint and being wary of our overconfidence. Evidently, contents that do
      not promote better habits should be given lower ratings, while contents that promote
      poor habits, purposely or not, should be given very low ratings.

      Contents that score high on "encourages better habits" should be successful
