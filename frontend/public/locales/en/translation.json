  "criteriaDescriptions": {
    "backfire_risk": "<0>Is it adapted to viewers with opposing beliefs? Does it prevent misconceptions or undesirable reactions?</0><1>This criterion aims to measure the probability that a user may misunderstand or negatively react to the information presented. This may be particularly likely to occur for contents presented with a strong \"us versus them\" atmosphere on controversial topics<1>(<1>BailABBC+-18</1>)</1>. Note, however, that this <4>Veritasium video</4> (based on his <8>PhD thesis</8>) shows that backfiring also occurs for clean presentation of a counter-intuitive scientific concept, if the content does not pinpoint the risks of misunderstandings.</1><2>Contents that score high on \"resilience to backfiring risks\" should be safe to recommend to all sorts of viewers, with limited risks of misunderstandings.</2>",
    "better_habits": "<0>Does it make people adopt habits that benefit themselves and beyond?</0><1>This criterion aims to highlight content that nudges viewers towards better habits, for themselves or for society. These habits may include healthier habits, in terms of food, sport activities or mental health, or more careful thinking when consuming informational contents. They may also include more altruistic habits, such as being kinder to others (including on the Internet), reducing our carbon footprint and being wary of our overconfidence. Evidently, contents that do not promote better habits should be given lower ratings, while contents that promote poor habits, purposely or not, should be given very low ratings.</1><2>Contents that score high on \"encourages better habits\" should be successful at motivating viewers to grow and improve themselves.</2>",
    "diversity_inclusion": "<0>Does it promote tolerance, compassion and wider moral considerations?</0><1>This criterion aims at identifying contents that promote a more diverse and inclusive view of the great diversity of all life. Contents that score high on \"diversity and inclusion\" should celebrate diversity and be appealing to minority groups. Among other things, diverse and inclusive content promote:</1><2><0>The diversity of humanity's ethnics, beliefs and preferences, especially in fields that deeply lack such a diversity,</0><1>The lifes of all sentient beings (e.g. non-human animals),</1><2>The well-being of young and future generations,</2><3>The diversity of genders and sexual orientations,</3><4>The inclusion of all species in our moral circles and the protection of biodiversity.</4></2><3>When judging this feature, contributors are encouraged to reflect on what both privileged and underprivileged viewers may feel when viewing the content. Contents that normalize biases or that disregard the interests of under-represented groups, purposely or not, should be rated negatively along this feature.</3><4>Example</4><5>Typically the below videos may be referred to as high diversity and inclusion.</5><6><0><0>Tibees' video \"The First Computer Program\"</0></0><1><0>Mark Robert's video \"The Truth About my Son\"</0></1><2><0>Jaiden Animations' video \"Being not Straight\"</0></2><3><0>Vox's video \"Are we Automating Racism?\"</0></3></6>",
    "engaging": "<0>Does it catch people's attention, spark curiosity and invite to question previous beliefs?</0><1>When judging this quality feature, the contributors are typically invited to ask themselves if their relatives would be bored by the content, or if the content has a chance to start an interesting discussion or to encourage further research on the topic.</1><2>Contents that score high on \"engaging and thought-provoking\" should catch the attention of a larger audience, trigger their curiosity and create a desire to find out more, including by questioning their own beliefs.</2><3>Engaging</3><4>The dynamism of the video, the use of humour or the audiovisual quality of the story-telling are important components to consider.</4><5>This <2>Veritasium video</2> presents advice for more engaging science videos.</5><6>Thought-provoking</6><7>A video is thought-provoking if it invites further, perhaps unusual, thoughts for viewers. It may typically be more successful at doing so if it raises further questions, encourages viewers to reflect further and provides pointers to find out more.</7><8>Curiosity</8><9>As opposed to many metrics including \"scientific intelligence\"<1>(<1>KahanPCS-17</1>)</1>, scientific curiosity has been linked to a convergence of beliefs despite diverging political views <4>(<1>KahanLCHH-17</1>)</4>.</9><10><0>Galef-21</0> argues that the greatest bottleneck to good judgment is usually the will to adopt the \"scout mindset\", which is defined as accuracy motivated reasoning or intellectual honesty. This is as opposed to the \"soldier mindset\", which corresponds to belief motivated reasoning.</10>",
    "entertaining_relaxing": "<0>Do people feel good watching it?</0><1>Contents that score high on \"entertaining and relaxing\" should entertain and relax viewers.</1>",
    "importance": "<0>Can additional focus on this topic have a significantly positive impact on the world?</0><1>This criterion aims to combat the problem of <1>mute news</1>, which are information that do not have the attention that they should have for the good of humanity and beyond. As an example, as explained by <4>this PBS Hot Mess video</4>, when it comes to mitigating climate change, asking viewers to switch off the light when not at home is orders of magnitude less important than, say, avoid flying to countries far away.</1><2>Contents that score high on \"important and actionable\" should present data and arguments with major consequences, as well as actionable plans that would have large-scale impacts.</2><3>Scale</3><4>Plans with large-scale impacts are more important, as they affect more individuals at once.</4><5>Actionable and tractable</5><6>A content that simply lists problem is arguably less important to share than a content that both lists problems and propose actionable solutions.</6><7>The content is all the more important if it calls for actionable plans from the viewers (even though these plans may consist in creating social pressure on other individuals).</7><8>Other aspects</8><9>When judging the importance of a content, it may be relevant to reflect on whether the content stresses the important features of the topic it discusses. In particular, introductions and conclusions may be what catches viewers' attention the most. Does the content open and close with important considerations?</9><10>According to Bayesianism, <1>surprising</1> data ought to have a much larger impact on a (Bayesian) viewer's beliefs. In practice, viewers are not Bayesian. This is why, in addition to presenting surprising data to viewers, it is also important to also stress the surprisingness of the data or argument, by highlighting it. This means underlining the neglectedness of the data or argument.</10>",
    "largely_recommended": "<0>This is the default quality criterion of Tournesol 🌻</0><1>It aims to measure the extent to which a content should be recommended to a very wide audience, according to the contributor's judgment.</1><2>The main motivation for making this the single default quality criterion is that it highlights the core of Tournesol's mission. Namely, Tournesol aims to identify contents worth promoting at scale.</2><3>A secondary motivation is to make it as contributor-friendly as possible, especially for new contributors.</3><4>A third motivation is to use this quality criterion to infer the importance assigned by the contributors the the other quality criteria. In particular, we plan to soon learn how to best combine the different optional quality criteria (and the default one) into a more reliable unique global Tournesol score per video.</4>",
    "layman_friendly": "<0>How understandable is it, without prior knowledge?</0><1>This criterion aims to identify contents that would be suitable to those with very limited prior knowledge. When judging this feature, contributors are encouraged to reflect on the suitability of the content to their grandparents or to their 5-year-old nephew.</1><2>Contents that score high on \"layman-friendly\" should be accessible to a very large audience.</2><3>Distinction with \"clear and pedagogical\"</3><4>An example of layman-friendly non-pedagogical video is a video discussing concepts in a very superficial way.</4><5>An example of a very pedagogical video that may not be very layman-friendly is <2>this video by 3Blue1Brown</2>.</5>",
    "pedagogy": "<0>How efficiently does the content guide viewers in their understanding?</0><1>This criterion aims to measure the clarity of the explanations of a content. More importantly, this <2>Veritasium video</2> argues that what really matters is what is going on in the viewer's head as they watch the video. A pedagogical content should thus accompany the viewers adequately along every challenging step of an argument or of the analysis of some data.</1><2>Contents that score high on \"clear and pedagogical\" should help viewers understand all the elements that lead to a conclusion.</2>",
    "reliability": "<0>Is the presented information trustworthy, robustly backed and properly nuanced?</0><1>This criterion aims to measure the trustworthiness of the information presented in a content, but also the extent to which the information may be misleading. In particular, a factual content that cherry-picks data to present to corroborate a world view and lacks completeness should be considered partially misleading. Similarly, contents that lack epistemic prudence and suffer overconfidence may be considered less reliable than contents that adequately measure the extent of their ignorance.</1><2>Contents that score high on \"reliable and not misleading\" should make nearly all viewers improve their global world view, despite viewers' biases and motivated reasoning.</2><3>Reliability</3><4>The multiplicity and diversity of sources and evidence play an important role in the reliability of a content. It should ideally be also backed by <2>peer-reviewed scientific publications</2>. However, as explained in <5>this video by Veritasium</5>, even published research usually has major shortcomings. More reliable information can be obtained by meta-analyses of multiple scientific publications, or by drawing on scientific consensus.</4><5>Even then, even meta-analysis <1>may not be conclusive</1>, especially when data are not compelling enough. A reliable analysis of the data should acknowledge uncertainty<3>(<1>WassersteinSL-19</1>)</3> by showing epistemic prudence, thereby combatting overconfidence. Ideally, the level of certainty should be well calibrated.</5><6>Not misleading</6><7>Unfortunately, factual news can be deeply misleading. As an example, on October 21st, 2020, NBC News published a news entitled <2>\"Volunteer in AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine trial dies in Brazil\"</2>. However, subsequent news reported that the volunteer did not receive the vaccine, as he was in the control group. Weirdly, this was reported by Healthcare Finance in a news entitled <5>\"28-year-old volunteer in AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial dies\"</5>. Only the subtitle clarifies the story, as it asserts \"The trial has not been paused as the volunteer did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine but was part of the control group.\". Still, more generally, even a death of a single vaccinated individual should not radically affect our estimation of the dangerousness of the vaccine, as the cause of the death may be unrelated to the individual's vaccination. In fact, if tens of thousands of individuals get vaccinated, then a death of at least one individual should be expected in the months to come since; according at <8>Statista</8>, adults have a probability of dying within a year of at least 1 in 1,000.</7><8><0>ChevrePensante-21<1>FR</1></0> reports the way vaccine news have been reported in a disproportionally negative manner.</8><9>More generally, to avoid being misleading, information should arguably present on scientific background knowledge, set information within context, analyze the best available statistical data, discuss conflicting interpretations and use careful wordings.</9>"
