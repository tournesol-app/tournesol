""" Step 4 of the pipeline.
    
Scaling addresses the "Parisian" and the "Marseillais" problems,

or whose negative scores correspond to entities that others rate as positive.
This latter effect is particularly an issue in comparison-based preference learning,
assuming each user has a very specific selection bias of rated entities.
