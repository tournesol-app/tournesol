# Understanding Algorithmic Governance

This part of the documentation aims to provide a thorough understanding of **Solidago**.
More precisely, it hopes to:

- Introduce the main challenges of algorithmic governance.
- Standardize the concepts and the notations.
- Present the motivations and mathematical guarantees of **Solidago**'s algorithms.
- State open conjectures to motivate research.

Here are the main sections of this part of the documentation:

- [An overview of algorithmic governance](overview/index.md).
- [Preference learning](preference_learning/index.md).
- [Preference scaling](scaling/index.md).
- [Preference aggregation](aggregation/index.md).
- [Privacy](privacy/index.md).
- [Trust and voting rights](trust/index.md).
- [User and entity clustering](clustering/index.md).
